7. Short-Term Memory (Conversation Context)
● Implement short-term conversational memory
● Memory should:
○ Maintain context across multiple user queries
○ Be limited to the current session only


answer:

1. Enable short-term conversational memory so the chatbot can recall context during a session.

2. Maintain context across multiple user queries (e.g., if the user asks a follow-up question, the chatbot remembers the previous topic).

3. Limit memory to the current session only — once the session ends, all stored context is cleared.

4. Do not persist memory across sessions (no long-term storage).

5. Use context chaining: each new query is interpreted in relation to earlier queries within the same session.
